# SwiftUI YouTube Downloader (macOS)

![status: learning project](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-learning-yellow)

> ⚠️ **Note:** I'm new to SwiftUI and Xcode. This project is part of my learning journey as I explore macOS development for the first time.

This is a future macOS app built with SwiftUI that will serve as a simple YouTube audio/video downloader. It’s based on an AppleScript version I made earlier, but this version will use a full SwiftUI interface and be more polished.
