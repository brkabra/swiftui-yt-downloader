# SwiftUI YouTube Downloader (macOS)
**Status:** Learning project

⚠️ **Note:** This repo is part of my Swift/SwiftUI learning journey. The main goal is to rebuild my old AppleScript-based YouTube downloader into a native macOS app with a SwiftUI interface.

## 🎯 Purpose
- Learn Swift and SwiftUI (macOS app development basics)
- Explore how to run shell tools (`yt-dlp` + `ffmpeg`) from Swift
- Replace the AppleScript version with a polished SwiftUI app
- Track learning progress (see `dev/learning` branch)

## ✅ Planned Features
- Text input for YouTube links (with clipboard auto-fill)
- Picker for download format (MP3 or MP4)
- Shell integration with `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg`
- File output to `~/Music` or `~/Movies`
- Progress and status feedback

## 🛠 Tools
- Swift + SwiftUI
- Xcode (macOS)
- yt-dlp and ffmpeg

## 🧪 Current Status
🟡 **Learning phase.**  
Currently experimenting with SwiftUI basics (e.g., buttons, text updates, state variables). See `learning_log.md` in `dev/learning` for daily notes.

## 📚 Learning Disclaimer

This is a beginner project. I'm learning Swift and Xcode as I go, so some parts may be incomplete or inefficient. Feel free to leave tips or feedback,  I’m here to improve.
